This allows fast look up of elements by attributes like id, type,\n\t// and class.\n\t\n\tvar _vex = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tvar X = exports.X = _vex.Vex.MakeException('RegistryError');\n\t\n\tfunction setIndexValue(index, name, value, id, elem) {\n\t  if (!index[name][value]) index[name][value] = {};\n\t  index[name][value][id] = elem;\n\t}\n\t\n\tvar Registry = exports.Registry = function () {\n\t  _createClass(Registry, null, [{\n\t    key: 'INDEXES',\n\t    get: function get() {\n\t      return ['type'];\n\t    }\n\t  }]);\n\t\n\t  function Registry() {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, Registry);\n\t\n\t    this.clear();\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // If you call `enableDefaultRegistry`, any new elements will auto-register with\n\t  // the provided registry as soon as they're constructed.\n\t\n\t\n\t  _createClass(Registry, [{\n\t    key: 'clear',\n\t    value: function clear() {\n\t      // Indexes are represented as maps of maps (of maps).

The algorithm can align multiple voices both\n\t// within a stave, and across multiple staves.\n\t//\n\t// To do this, the formatter breaks up voices into a grid of rational-valued\n\t// `ticks`, to which each note is assigned. Then, minimum widths are assigned\n\t// to each tick based on the widths of the notes and modifiers in that tick. This\n\t// establishes the smallest amount of space required for each tick.\n\t//\n\t// Finally, the formatter distributes the left over space proportionally to\n\t// all the ticks, setting the `x` values of the notes in each tick.\n\t//\n\t// See `tests/formatter_tests.js` for usage examples. The helper functions included\n\t// here (`FormatAndDraw`, `FormatAndDrawTab`) also serve as useful usage examples.\n\t\n\tvar _vex = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _beam = __webpack_require__(15);\n\t\n\tvar _tables = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _fraction = __webpack_require__(3);\n\t\n\tvar _voice = __webpack_require__(18);\n\t\n\tvar _staveconnector = __webpack_require__(19);\n\t\n\tvar _stavenote = __webpack_require__(20);\n\t\n\tvar _note = __webpack_require__(22);\n\t\n\tvar _modifiercontext = __webpack_require__(27);\n\t\n\tvar _tickcontext = __webpack_require__(39);\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\t// To enable logging for this class.
